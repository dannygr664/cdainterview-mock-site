# CDA Interview Mock Site

A mock website I built for a job application using a Kirby CMS, hosted locally via Laravel Valet, and shared using ngrok.

## Running the site locally

First, make sure you have [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/valet) installed. Clone this repo into your `park`ed directory (e.g. `~/Sites`). Now you can access this site on your machine at [http://cdainterview-mock-site.test](http://cdainterview-mock-site.test), and the panel at [http://cdainterview-mock-site.test/panel](http://cdainterview-mock-site.test/panel).

## Sharing the site with others

To share your local site via an [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs) tunnel, run: `valet share`. This will output a shareable link that is active until you close you tunnel.
